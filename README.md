# JavaScript_Exercise
This is a personal repository for frontend learning. This repo will keep updating until I got a Web-dev engineer job. Hope that day is not too far away.

Code pratices and leetcode answers are written in vanilla JavaScript. No worry for node_modules, though you may need ESLint for syntax checking and some other stuff.

## Notes
See directory `/note`. Notes are categorized by language and framework. Note that some notes are not completed, which will be finished in future, or never.

## Pratices
### Data structure
- `/src/algorithms` for data structure implementations. Nothing fancy here.
- `/src/functions` for popular JS function implementations. You can find solutions for most tech interview questions here. Totally useful.
- `/src/designPattern` for common JS design pattern implementations. Not many, but critical.
- `/src/css` for common CSS layout implementations. For detailed notes, check these notes: 
    - [Columns Layout](note/css/Columns_Layout.md)
    - [Flex](note/css/Flex.md)
    - [Float](note/css/Float.md)

### LeetCode
See `/src/leetcode` for leetcode problem solutions implemented in vanilla JS. All solutions are categorized by tag.

Code comments are written in Chinese for my convenience. But most people should be able to understand the idea bebind those lines of code.

## Handy npm scripts for LeetCode revision
- `npm run rand`: Open a random local LeetCode problem in VSCode.
- `npm run rand100`: Open a random top 100 LeetCode problem in VSCode. Top 100 ranking data is fetched from `http://codetop.cc/home` with local cache.

Script source files are located in `/src/script`.

## Reference
My browser bookmarks are way too many to write every single link down here, I will just leave a few links which I think are pretty useful.
